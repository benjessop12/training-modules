*THIS FILE IS INCOMPLETE. WE WILL COMPLETE IT OVER TIME IN SUBSEQUENT SESSIONS*

_Designed for various levels of introspection from external views where discussing internal implementation details creates unncessary noise to in depth views of system internals._

_Guidance: this page is structured to tell the following story_

* What does it do?
* Who does it impact?
* How does it do it?
* How is it run?

When describing an architecture the guidelines of the ISO/EIC/IEE 42010 systems and software engineering architecture description standard are followed. According to this standard an architecture description must:

* Contain multiple standard architectural views
* Maintain traceability between design decisions and architectural requirements
|===

A system's architecture is defined as the infrastructure within which application components satisfy functional requirements can specified, deployed and executed.

* Functional requirements are the expected functions of the system and its components.
* Non-functional requirements are measures through which the quality of the system can be measured.


==== Behavioural View

The behavioural view shows how components and layers interact with one another. This is useful when creating scenarios for testing architecture designs and for understanding the system end-to-end.
